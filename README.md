# Predicting Hospital Stay Duration  
## Project Overview  

This project focuses on predicting the duration of hospital stays using patient demographics, health conditions, admission types, and other related data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to optimize hospital resource management, reduce patient wait times, and improve overall healthcare outcomes.

## Dataset  

**Domain**: Healthcare Analytics  
**Key Features**:  
- **Numerical**: `Available_Extra_Rooms_in_Hospital`, `Visitors_with_Patient`, `Admission_Deposit`  
- **Categorical**: `Type_of_Admission`, `Severity_of_Illness`, `Department`, `Insurance`  
- **Target**: `Stay (in days)`  

Data preprocessing included handling missing values (e.g., 30% missing in `health_conditions`) and retaining outliers to preserve critical insights.
